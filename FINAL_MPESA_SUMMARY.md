## ❌ Issues Remaining

### Issue 1: C2B Callback Not Received (QR Payments)
**Problem:** When you scan QR and pay, the system doesn't receive the callback

**Why:** C2B URLs not registered with Safaricom

**Solution:** Register C2B URLs

### Issue 2: "The request is not permitted according to product assignment"
**Problem:** STK Push failing with this error

**Why:** Your Passkey doesn't match your Shortcode (3560959)

**Solution:** Get correct Passkey from Daraja Portal

---

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### Action 1: Register C2B URLs (For QR Code Callbacks)

**Step 1: Verify ngrok is running**
```
https://125023d8524c.ngrok-free.app
```

**Step 2: Register URLs**
```
POST https://localhost:5001/api/MpesaTest/register-c2b

Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "C2B URLs registered successfully"
}
```

**What this does:**
- Tells Safaricom where to send QR payment notifications
- Enables automatic linking of QR payments to sales
- Must be done once per ngrok session

### Action 2: Fix STK Push Credentials

**Get Correct Passkey:**
1. Go to: https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/
2. Login → My Apps → Your App
3. Click: "Lipa Na M-Pesa Online"
4. Find: Business Short Code: 3560959
5. Copy: Passkey

**Update Config:**
```json
"Passkey": "YOUR_CORRECT_PASSKEY_FROM_DARAJA"
```
