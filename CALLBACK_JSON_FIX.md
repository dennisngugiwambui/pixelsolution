# ✅ M-Pesa Callback JSON Parsing Fixed

## 🔴 The Problem

**Error:** `System.InvalidOperationException: The requested operation requires an element of type 'String', but the target element has type 'Number'.`

**What happened:**
- Payment succeeded ✅
- M-Pesa sent callback ✅
- Callback reached your server ✅
- **JSON parsing failed** ❌

**Why:**
Safaricom sends some values as **numbers** (not strings):
- `Amount`: 150 (number, not "150")
- `TransactionDate`: 20251001173500 (number, not "20251001173500")
- `PhoneNumber`: 254758024400 (number, not "254758024400")

But the code was trying to read them all as strings.

---

## ✅ The Fix

Updated callback handler to handle **both numbers and strings**:

```csharp
case "Amount":
    // Handle both number and string
    if (value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Number)
    {
        amountReceived = value.GetDecimal();
    }
    else if (value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.String)
    {
        decimal.TryParse(value.GetString(), out var amount);
        amountReceived = amount;
    }
    break;

case "TransactionDate":
    // Handle both number and string
    transactionDate = value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Number 
        ? value.GetInt64().ToString() 
        : value.GetString();
    break;

case "PhoneNumber":
    // Handle both number and string
    phoneNumber = value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Number 
        ? value.GetInt64().ToString() 
        : value.GetString();
    break;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Restart Application
```
Stop (Shift+F5)
Start (F5)
```

### 2. Test Payment Again
```
1. Add item (KSH 150)
2. Select M-Pesa
3. Enter phone: 758024400
4. Complete payment
5. Enter PIN
6. Wait for callback
```

### 3. Check Logs
```
Look for:
📥 MPESA Callback received
💳 MPESA Receipt: TJ1LL68ZST
💰 Amount received: 150
✅ Payment successful for sale: SAL202510010003
```

### 4. Verify Database
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    SaleId,
    SaleNumber,
    Status,
    MpesaReceiptNumber,
    TotalAmount,
    AmountPaid
FROM Sales
WHERE PaymentMethod = 'M-Pesa'
ORDER BY SaleDate DESC;
```

**Expected:**
- Status: "Completed" ✅
- MpesaReceiptNumber: "TJ1LL68ZST" ✅
- AmountPaid: 150 ✅

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (BROKEN):
```csharp
case "Amount":
    if (decimal.TryParse(value.GetString(), out var amount))  // ❌ Crashes if number
    {
        amountReceived = amount;
    }
    break;
```

### After (FIXED):
```csharp
case "Amount":
    if (value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Number)  // ✅ Check type first
    {
        amountReceived = value.GetDecimal();
    }
    else if (value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.String)
    {
        decimal.TryParse(value.GetString(), out var amount);
        amountReceived = amount;
    }
    break;
```

```

### Manual Database Check:
```sql
-- Check if callback was processed
SELECT * FROM MpesaTransactions 
WHERE CheckoutRequestId = 'ws_CO_...'
AND Status = 'Completed';

-- Check if sale was completed
SELECT * FROM Sales
WHERE SaleNumber = 'SAL202510010003'
AND Status = 'Completed';
```
