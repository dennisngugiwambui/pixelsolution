## 🎯 What Safaricom Support Said

BusinessShortcode – Store number or HO number (shortcode used to go live)
PartyB – Till number 
TransactionType – CustomerBuyGoodsOnline
```

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. Updated STK Push Request
```csharp
BusinessShortCode = "3560959"  // Store/HO number
PartyB = "6509715"              // Till number
TransactionType = "CustomerBuyGoodsOnline"  // Changed from CustomerPayBillOnline
```

### 2. Updated Configuration Files
```json
"Shortcode": "3560959",          // Store/HO number
"TillNumber": "6509715",          // Till number
"TransactionType": "CustomerBuyGoodsOnline"  // Buy Goods transaction
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### STK Push Request:
```json
{
  "BusinessShortCode": "3560959",
  "Password": "base64(3560959+Passkey+Timestamp)",
  "Timestamp": "20251001172400",
  "TransactionType": "CustomerBuyGoodsOnline",
  "Amount": "10",
  "PartyA": "254758024400",

}
```

- ✅ **TransactionType** = CustomerBuyGoodsOnline
